                    <h2>CREDIT APPLICATION PROCESS:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>        
            Step 1:
            The application process includes a request that you provide
            African Bank with all information about your monthly income and<br />
            expenses so that the bank can determine whether you can afford
            the loan.
                </li>
            <br />
                <li>
            Step 2:
            Our consultants use the above information along with information
            from the credit bureau to analyse your monthly expenses and<br />
            calculate the instalment you can afford to pay.<br /> We want to make
            sure you do not experience financial difficulty while repaying your
            loan.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            If your application for credit is unsuccessful, you may ask for written reasons
            as to why your application was declined. If your credit application is declined
            because of information recorded on the credit bureau, African Bank will
            provide you with the details and contact information that will enable you to
            make an enquiry at the credit bureau.
            If you fail to inform African Bank of your inability to pay the instalments or
            if you provide incorrect information, you may not be fully protected by the
            NCA (National Credit Act 34 of 2005).
